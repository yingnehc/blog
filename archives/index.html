<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper provides the first empirical evidence that food delivery platforms change the landscape of urban consumption amenities. Applying a difference-in-differences framework to a novel granular dataset with proprietary information, we study the impacts of food delivery platforms on local cuisine diversity and the economic geography of restaurants in China. We find that food delivery platforms increase the number of restaurants, restaurant entries and exits, and cuisine diversity while reducing restaurants’ spatial concentration and price levels. The effects are nonlinear across counties of different market sizes and degrees of urbanization, narrowing the core-peripheral gap in accessibility to consumption amenities.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Place-Based Policies: First-Mover Advantage and Persistence</em></strong>, with Teng Huang and Wenzhuo Lu, under review</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Researchers have studied various place-based policies aimed at promoting economic growth, but little attention has been paid to how timing and policy contexts can foster agglomeration. In this study, we use a general equilibrium framework to examine how productivity spillovers resulting from a policy-driven foreign entry in early development zones can affect firms’ decisions on technology upgrading, production locations, and firm sizes. Guided by the model’s predictions, we collected comprehensive archival data and empirically demonstrated heterogeneous growth trends between early and late development zones. These trends are exhibited in persistent firm entries, innovation, and labor pooling.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent around the world. Urban residents in developing countries have become more vulnerable to health shocks due to poor sanitation and infrastructure. This paper is the first to empirically measure the relationship between weather and health shocks in the urban context of a developing country. Using unique high-frequency datasets of weekly cholera cases and accumulated precipitation for wards in Dar es Salaam, we find robust evidence that extreme rainfall has a significant positive impact on weekly cholera incidence. The effect is larger in wards that are more prone to flooding, have higher shares of informal housing and unpaved roads. We identify limited spatial spillovers. Time-dynamic effects suggest cumulated rainfall increases cholera occurrence immediately and with a lag of up to 5 weeks.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Pollution Regulation and Local Firm Productivity Growth</em></strong>, with Wenjie Wu and Yanwen Yun, draft available upon request</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper evaluates the impact of China’s first air pollution regulation on firm productivity growth. We compile a comprehensive dataset to follow identical firms over a ten-year period since the policy implementation. Utilizing the instrumental variable of power plant suitability to predict the treatment of environmental regulation, we find that firms located in strictly regulated counties experience slower productivity growth relative to firms in less regulated counties. The IV estimates are twice the magnitude of corresponding OLS estimates. Firm and spatial heterogeneity of the regulatory effect are also explored.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the impact of environmental regulation on the local labor markets by exploiting China’s first air pollution regulation as a natural experiment. The identification strategy uses a novel instrumental variable based on engineering considerations related to coal-burning activities. The analysis shows that the pollution regulation has led to employment decline in the targeted prefectures and sectors, mainly through the channel of firm exits. Furthermore, detailed census data with worker characteristics are used to examine skill heterogeneity and regulation-induced spatial transition costs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines political favoritism of cites in national capital markets and the effect of that favoritism on city sizes. The paper estimates the city-by-city variation in the prices of capital across cities in China from 1998 to 2007. It relates how the prices facing the highest order political units and overall cross-city price dispersion change with changes in national policy and leadership. The effect of capital market favoritism on city growth after the national relaxation of migration restrictions in the early 2000’s is investigated. The elasticity of the city growth rate with respect to the price of capital is estimated to be - 0.07 in the OLS approach and -0.12 in the IV approach.</p>

As recommended by others, I have tried TextWrangler, Smultron, and TextMate (the trial/free version, of course). Among the above-mentioned, I liked TextWrangler the most. But in one way or another, they can’t match the same level of user-friendliness of Notepad++ on Windows.</p>
<p>This frustration led me to step into the realm of real programmers and start learning to use Aquamacs (based on GNU Emacs but has a Mac-looking interface). For starters, it is undoubtedly more challenging to learn than Notepad++. However, it is great for editing STATA do-files, TeX files, R scripts (which Aquamacs can run internally), etc. It is, in my opinion, also the best free TeX editor for both Windows and Mac OS. You could also use it to compare files, which is handy if you want to tell apart similar do-files. And these are just the tip of the iceberg of what Aquamacs is capable of. In short, Aquamacs will be worth your investment (of time) in the long run.</p>
<p><em>This note only offers a few useful links. If you run into trouble with any of them, or find anything difficult to follow, feel free to contact me via email.</em></p>
<p>Set up Aquamacs: Download and install <a href="http://aquamacs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquamacs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting started with Aquamacs:</strong> is essentially the same as Emacs. Therefore, almost all Emacs help files apply to Aquamacs. A thorough introduction by Jeremy Zawodny can be found <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Emacs-Beginner-HOWTO.html#toc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The most useful chapters for me are 2, 4, and 5. Make sure you follow through the tutorials closely.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating with Stata:</strong> unfortunately, Stata does not come as a default Emacs mode. But this is made possible and simple thanks to Bill Rising and his ado-mode. Please follow his tutorial <a href="http://louabill.org/Stata/send2stata.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Integrating with LaTeX:</strong> Tex mode comes as default with Emacs and is made better with the AUCTeX extension <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
